                        Alongside my official duties, I have provided training sessions in time series analysis in Python and PowerBI to colleagues, and produced a <a target="_blank" href="https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/dfv1/machine_learning/TimeSeriesGuide.html">guide to time series analysis in Python</a>. More recently, I have been part-time seconded to the curriculum development team and built a level 6 Applied Statistics course. I also built a Python app using calendar and email APIs to automate admin tasks for myself and colleagues, saving 30-60mins per person per week.
